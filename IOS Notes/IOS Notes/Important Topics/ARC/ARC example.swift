                        ðŸ”„ The Retain Cycle  or Strong Reference Cycle
 
 Now both john and toyota are holding to each other.
 If we later write john = nil and toyota = nil,
 they wonâ€™t be destroyed from memory because they are still pointing to each other â€” this is called a retain cycle or strong reference cycle.
