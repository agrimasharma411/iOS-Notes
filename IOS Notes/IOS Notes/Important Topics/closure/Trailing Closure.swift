                      //âœ… Normal Closure Syntax:
//You write the closure inside the parentheses as a parameter.

//func sayHi(completion: () -> Void) {
//    completion()
//}
//
//sayHi(completion: {
//    print("Hi there!")  // ðŸ‘ˆ Closure written INSIDE ()
//})
//ðŸ‘‰ This is called Normal Closure Syntax.

                            //âœ… Trailing Closure Syntax:


//You write the closure outside the parentheses if it's the last (or only) parameter.


//sayHi {
//    print("Hi there!")  // ðŸ‘ˆ Closure written OUTSIDE ()
//}
//ðŸ‘‰ This is called Trailing Closure Syntax.
//
//ðŸ’¡ Shortcut Rule:
//If closure is last parameter â†’ you can use trailing closure.
//If closure is not last â†’ you must use normal syntax.
