 üöÄExplanation---------------------->>>>>>
 
 ‚û°Ô∏è Creates a new object named house from the House class.

 This is an instance of the House class.

 At this moment, house.owner is nil by default, because we haven't assigned anything to it yet.

 Why? Because in the class definition:

 class House {
     var owner: Owner?  // optional, so default is nil
 }
 üîπ Line 2:

 house.owner = Owner()
 ‚û°Ô∏è We‚Äôre now assigning a new Owner object to the owner property of house.

 So now, house.owner is not nil

 But house.owner?.dog is still nil (we haven‚Äôt assigned the dog yet)

 üîπ Line 3:

 house.owner?.dog = Dog(name: "Bruno")
 ‚û°Ô∏è This line uses optional chaining (?.) to safely assign a new Dog object to the dog property of the owner.

 Since house.owner is not nil, Swift allows setting dog to a new Dog(name: "Bruno")

 If house.owner were nil, this line would silently do nothing, avoiding a crash
