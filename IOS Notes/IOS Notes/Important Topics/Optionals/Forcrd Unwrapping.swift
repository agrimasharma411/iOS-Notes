                    🚀 FORCED UNWRAP
 
 🔥 What is Force Unwrapping?
 Force unwrapping means telling Swift: “I’m 100% sure this optional has a value — unwrap it now.”
 You do this using the ! operator.
 
 
 🧠 Interview Answer:
  Force unwrappingin Swift is done using !, and it's used to access the value inside an optional without any safety check.
 It's a quick way to unwrap, but it should only be used when you're 100% certain the value is not nil.
 Otherwise, it leads to a runtime crash.
