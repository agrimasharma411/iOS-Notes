 📌 1. What is SSL Pinning? Why is it needed?
 🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰
 Answer:
 SSL Pinning is a technique where we hardcode the server’s SSL certificate or public key inside the app.
 It ensures that the app connects only to the trusted server, not any server with a valid HTTPS certificate — to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

 📌 2. How do you implement SSL Pinning in Swift?

 Answer:
 We download the server’s .cer file, add it to the app bundle, and during URLSession connection, we compare the server's live certificate with the local .cer using URLSessionDelegate.

 📌 3. Where do you get the .cer file from?

 Answer:
 We get it from the browser or terminal.
 Example:

 Visit https://yourapi.com → click padlock → view certificate → export as .cer
 Or

 Use terminal: openssl s_client -connect yourapi.com:443 | openssl x509 > yourserver.cer

 📌 4. What happens if the certificate doesn’t match?

 Answer:
 The app blocks the connection.
 URLSession will cancel the API request, and the user will not be able to proceed.

 📌 5. What are the types of SSL Pinning?

 Answer:

 Type    Description
 Certificate Pinning    Compare full .cer file
 Public Key Pinning    Extract and compare only the public key part of certificate (better for cert renewal)

 📌 6. Is SSL Pinning compulsory in every app?
 🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰
 Answer:
 No, not compulsory.
 But it’s recommended for sensitive apps — like banking, payments, or anything with personal data.

 🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰
 📌 7. Can the app be broken if hacker extracts your .cer file from app?
 🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰🀰
 Answer:
 Yes, if the app is not well protected, attackers can reverse-engineer the app and bypass the pinning logic using tools like Frida or SSL Kill Switch.
 So we should combine pinning with techniques like obfuscation and Jailbreak detection.
