Q1: What is Firebase and why use it?
--------------------------------------------------------------

1Ô∏è‚É£ Short interview-style answer

Firebase is a Backend-as-a-Service (BaaS) platform by Google. It offers ready-to-use backend services like authentication, database, file storage, push notifications, analytics, etc., so we can focus on app development without managing our own server.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Extra detail

Firebase helps in rapid development ‚Äî no need to write backend APIs from scratch.

Automatically scales as user base grows.

Provides real-time database options.

Tight integration with iOS and Swift.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Example (previous project)

In my last project, we used Firebase Authentication for login/signup, Firestore to store user profiles, and Cloud Messaging for push notifications. This avoided the need to maintain our own backend and reduced development time significantly.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Hinglish version

Firebase ek Google ka platform hai jo backend ka kaam ready-made de deta hai ‚Äî jaise login system, database, file upload, push notification. Matlab mujhe server banane ka tension nahi lena padta, sirf app ka front-end banana hota hai. Jaise maine apne ek project me user ka data store karne ke liye Firestore use kiya aur login ke liye Firebase Auth. Sab kaam mast smooth ho gaya.
