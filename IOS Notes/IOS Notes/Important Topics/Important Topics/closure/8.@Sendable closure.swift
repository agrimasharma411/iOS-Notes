 1. If you use a global (shared) variable inside the closure â€” because it can be accessed from another thread at the same time â†’ this can cause a race condition, and @Sendable helps detect this and gives a warning.

 2. It also checks the logic inside the closure â€” like heavy loops, large JSON parsing, or other CPU-heavy tasks â€” and warns if the closure is unsafe to run on background threads.

 3. @Sendable indirectly warns if you're capturing self in a risky way. It prefers you to use [weak self] to avoid unsafe behavior in concurrent code.

 "@Sendable ensures closure is safe for multithreaded use â€” no shared state, no unsafe logic, and ideally no unsafe object captures."
