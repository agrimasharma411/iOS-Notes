    ✅ A closure is a type of function, but without a name.
    ✅ It can be assigned to a variable, passed as a parameter, or returned from a function.
    ✅ Closures can capture and store references to variables from their surrounding context — this is known as capturing values.
    ✅ Closures are widely used in things like completion handlers, animations, and callbacks.
